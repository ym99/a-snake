        <b> Island 1 (Kaui)</b>
            My Trip at Kaui was fun because their were a lot of beaches for little kids because they are so shallow.
        Also, the food their was amazing.

        <b> Island 2(Maui)</b>
                My trip at Maui was long because the island is huge. Also, their is a famous highway called Hana highway
            Hana Highway is for extreme driver's because their parts of the Highway that are only one way and you're
            quit high in the air. Also, the highway is 64 miles long.

            <b> Island 2(Oahu)</b>
                My trip at Oahu was fun. When I was at Oahu I stayed at one place for the whole trip. I stayed at Honolulu
             for mostly the trip. When I left Honolulu, I went to Pearl Harbor to vist the Battleship Missouri and the
            Memorial for the Battleship Arizona. I also went to the Pineapple farm and it was fun.

            <b> Missed Oportunity's in Hawaii (Big Island)</b>
                My missed oportunity at Hawaii was Big Island because their is a lot of stuff that I want to see
            like the volcano. The volcano is still active, so if you went up to the volcano you can see the lava.
