                My trip to Kauai was fun because there was a lot of beaches for little kids. The beaches in Kauai are shallow, and that is good for the little kids.
                Also, the food was amazing there.

            My trip to Maui was long because the island is huge. Also, there is a famous highway called Hana highway.
            Hana highway is for extreme drivers because there are parts of the Highway that are only one way and you're
            quite high in the air. Also, the highway is 64 miles long.

            My trip to Oahu was fun. When I was at Oahu I stayed at one place for the whole trip. I stayed at Honolulu
            most of the trip. When I left Honolulu, I went to Pearl Harbor to vist the Battleship Missouri and 
            the Battleship Arizona Memorial. I also went to the Pineapple farm and it was fun.

        <h2> Missed Oportunities in Hawaii (Big Island)</h2>

            My missed oportunities in Hawaii was Big Island because there is a lot of stuff that I wanted to see
            like the volcano. The volcano is still active, so if you went up to the volcano you can see the lava.
